One of the largest obstacles that I came across during the lab was the need to convert each of the letters in my name by hand to an ASCII value, and then from the ASCII value to a hexadecimal value without being able to use any of the online tools! I made each conversion as close to perfect as I could to avoid a simple conversion mistake, since one small mistake can be disastrous and ruin the entire final codeword. In addition, changing my birth year to use the binary in the division-by-2 method also took a while to understand; therefore, I had to take my time to double-check my steps to write the correct binary. Additionally, I also had a hard time creating a neat flowchart that showed my flow of logic. Since I had to write my logical steps, it certainly took time to simplify them down, and then stick together as many as I could to put in a flowchart that showed logical steps. All in all, the assignment was simple in concept, but doing everything by hand certainly kept me occupied, and it required combination of patience and focus to plan out the whole document while still coding.
